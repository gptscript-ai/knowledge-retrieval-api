Figure out what the LLama2 Paper located at ./examples/data/llama2.pdf says about "Truthfulness, Toxicity, and Bias" by
first ingesting it into the vector DB and then querying the vector DB.
Before ingesting, first check if the sha256sum appears on any line in the file ./examples/ingested.txt.
If it does, skip ingestion and assume that the file was already ingested.
If not, run the ingestion and write the sha256sum of the paper to ./examples/ingested.txt (append)
Do not query, before the file was fully ingested.
Give References. Abort if any step fails.
